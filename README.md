# cat-dog-CNN
Try to build a simple CNN model to classify cats and dogs

## Introduction

Build 4-layers and 5-layers CNN model with fully connected layers to practice on tuning hyperparameters, which are learning rate, batch size, and dropout rate

### cat&dog-v1.ipython 
  try to training a 4-layers Conv2D model with 0.5 dropout rate. finally get the 83% accuracy in validation set.<br>
  
###cat&dog-v2-findbestLR..ipynb 
  use LearningRateScheduler command to find the best start learning rate
