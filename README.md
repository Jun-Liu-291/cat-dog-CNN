# cat-dog-CNN
Try to build a simple CNN model to classify cats and dogs

Introduction
------------
Build 4-layers and 5-layers CNN model with fully connected layers to practice on tuning hyperparameters, which are learning rate, batch size, and dropout rate

cat&dog-v1.ipython try to training a 4-layers Conv2D model. finally get the 83% accuracy results

cat&dog-v2-findbestLR..ipynb create a test model to find the best learning rate for this model, by plot the learning rate - loss function chart, finding learning rate which can make loss function decrease stablely.
